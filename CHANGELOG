Version 0.2.0
* First stable version

Version 0.2.5
* Bug fixes
* Added more normalization methods

Version 0.3.0
* Bug fixes
* Optimized the normalization
* Unsupervised allows to center size factors by mean
* Unsupervised allows to computed adjuted log normalized counts
* Unsupervised allows to compute the number of clusters automatically
* Supervised allows to normalize the data
* Supervised allows to input train/classes with different spots
  than in the train/test data and in different order
* st_data_plotter allows to highlith selected spots
* st_data_plotter only plots the spots where the gene is present
  when a gene reg-exp is given
* st_data_plotter allows to normalize the data
* differential_analysis allows to normalize the data
* differential_analysis allows to input more than one dataset
